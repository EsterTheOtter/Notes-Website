    <h1>Basic</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Description</li>
          <p>A basic repository for raw thoughts, ruminations, and ideas. Better than a pad and paper, hopefully more organized. Probably will adapt setup as comfort with concepts grows.</p>
      </ul>

          <p>First note/thought- initial thoughts, doesn't look bad after running, doesn't look great either. Definitely improving this as time goes on. Current concepts and ideas running through head right now are concepts and applications well beyond current cope of understanding and comprehention, if not out of current comfort bounds that are current capabilities. Develope script to incorporate message logging within the website rather than through source code. Definitely want to get better understanding and read/interpret existing code (insert reinventing the wheel platitude bla bla bla). Don't waste time, but at least understand how the stuff works please (gotchu past me). Also getting better understanding of network security vs software security- thoughts: interesting. Takeaways: your hardware list/environment, in a workplace environment or professional setting (i.e. not a starbucks) is much more static than your software environment. That is to say, while management/monitoring of hardware shifts very little and can be relatively easy to detect shifts/changes, your software is more dynamic and volatile. Along with other concepts and properties discussed that are beyond current scope, at least have a sounder understanding of the interactions between individual computers and the net/web/whatever. Before moving on, recognized this par should be broken.</p>
        <p>Quantum accelerometer- quantum everything. Minus grievances on feelings regarding overuse of the word quantum, nonetheless interesting idea. For GPS, we need satellites in orbit to establish the baseline reference point necessary in tracking. An alternative for global navigation is use of accelerometer- for reasons beyond current scope of understanding, don't know why it's not possible with exception that it breaks down to aforementioned reference point. Some algorithm/calculation can be derived and used in association with accelerometer to establish mathematical baseline for current position and navigate that way? Pretty much localized GPS? Ideas on possible issues/why it's not a thing: dependant on region? Deployment could be network based- data from multiple baseline vehicles taken, coalesed, and used as the standard for that region? Anyway, conventional accelerometer must be recalibrated too frequently was the stated reason (according to article, could be more complex than that- need to read more on matter). Q accelerometer apperently will use supercooled particle as reference point for accuracy to resolve that issue. Again, issues probably in standardization and lack of infrastructure? Industry cannot produce equipment in large quantities either reliably or economically could be one. Point is- what would global navigation function/algorithm look like? Calling this 'Localized global navigation' project, could be fun to play around with and learn more about.</p>
        <p>Last thoughts- just hit run. Current entry bloated with text. Should continue logging visual description as likely will change in future as everything improves. Should help consolidate thoughts and keep self on track- no rabbit holes, bad. End log Mar 19, 2022:0045 (<--note need to code every entry to end like that- simple but kinda cool)</p>
      </ul>
    <h1>Review</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Mar 19, 2022:0049</li>
          <p>$^Script synchronized 'Notes' and 'Review' sections. Once 'Submit' or something has been hit, initialize review tab log to begin, stating time and date in previously given fashion.</p>
          <p>$Structure a responsive website for self, intend to continuously improve. Could be playground, should not be focused on too much- need diversity in projects- continue course projects and apply lessons there.</p>
